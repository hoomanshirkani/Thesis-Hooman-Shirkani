 \section{Problem definition }
Natural disasters encompass a variety of destructive situations, including volcanoes, earthquakes, tornadoes, eruptions, and more. The recent earthquake in Turkey underscored the importance of maintaining online connectivity for individuals trapped under collapsed buildings. It is essential to enhance the robustness and resilience of wireless networks in the face of natural disasters \cite{Santos5GNetworks}. Moreover, the robustness of 5G networks plays a significant role in strengthening smart grids, from management considerations to monitoring dimensions \cite{Wong2017EnhancingRings}. Features of 5G networks, such as ultra-low latency and ultra-reliability, serve as game-changers in establishing more dependable smart grids. Presently, smart grids rely heavily on intelligent energy generation resources and extensive grid monitoring, which is crucial for ensuring grid safety and stability.

In the aftermath of a disaster, the first few hours are critical for reaching people trapped in buildings or other inaccessible locations. Every minute counts during this time. Various scenarios may unfold after a disaster, with the potential for infrastructure and communication damage being inevitable. Thus, maintaining the operational status of the remaining infrastructure is crucial until the affected areas can be re-established.
\\ 
The approach that suggests the remaining part of the networks consist of the edge clouds and the base stations of the infrastructures can establish communication towards the serving of 5G virtual functions, which leads us to transfer slice processing and deploying mostly on the edge clouds till the defeated infrastructure will be redeployed.  To achieve this goal we encounter some obstacles like energy management due to power outage scenarios and process load balancing due to the difference congestion of based on user locations and weak or disrupted connections to the core network. 
\\
The primary objective of this thesis is to design and develop an intelligent slice placement framework that can dynamically adapt to various disaster scenarios by allocating each VNF of slices across edge systems while considering network constraints, energy efficiency, and load balancing. \\ This framework will incorporate Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models and a k-mean clustering algorithm to optimize VNF placement and minimize the impact of disaster-induced disruptions on 5G network performance.
\\
This research will contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance the resilience and survivability of 5G cellular access networks, ensuring reliable and high-quality services for end-users even during challenging disaster situations.


%To validate the proposed framework's effectiveness, different disaster scenarios will be evaluated, simulating power outages, core network disconnections, and network partitioning events. The results will be analyzed to demonstrate the improvements in network survivability, energy efficiency, and load balancing achieved by the proposed strategy during disaster scenarios.
\begin{tabular}{l l}
    $N$ & Set of edge clouds or nodes \\
    $S$ & Set of slices \\
    $A_i$ & Acceptance ratio of edge cloud or node $i \in N$ \\
    $C_i$ & CPU capacity of edge cloud or node $i \in N$ \\
    $B_i$ & Bandwidth capacity of edge cloud or node $i \in N$ \\
    $R_s$ & Required CPU capacity for slice $s \in S$ \\
    $W_s$ & Required bandwidth capacity for slice $s \in S$
\end{tabular}

Decision Variables:
\\
\begin{equation*}
    x_{is} \in \{0, 1\}, \text{ where } x_{is} = 1 \text{ if slice } s \in S \text{ is placed on edge cloud or node } i \in N, \text{ and } 0 \text{ otherwise.}
\end{equation*}

Objective Function:

We want to maximize the total acceptance ratio while considering the CPU and bandwidth capacities of each edge cloud or node:

\begin{equation*}
    \text{maximize} \sum_{i \in N} \sum_{s \in S} A_i \cdot x_{is}
\end{equation*}

Constraints:

Each slice must be placed on exactly one edge cloud or node:

\begin{equation*}
    \forall s \in S: \sum_{i \in N} x_{is} = 1
\end{equation*}

The total required CPU capacity for all slices placed on an edge cloud or node cannot exceed its CPU capacity:

\begin{equation*}
    \forall i \in N: \sum_{s \in S} R_s \cdot x_{is} \leq C_i
\end{equation*}

The total required bandwidth capacity for all slices placed on an edge cloud or node cannot exceed its bandwidth capacity:

\begin{equation*}
    \forall i \in N: \sum_{s \in S} W_s \cdot x_{is} \leq B_i
\end{equation*}

The decision variables are binary:

\begin{equation*}
    \forall i \in N, \forall s \in S: x_{is} \in \{0, 1\}
\end{equation*}
